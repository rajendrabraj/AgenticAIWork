🧠  Autogen Assignment to implement SOM and Autogen concepts

****Part A: Inner Team Integration 

🧑‍💻  ****Inner Team Integration.



* 📚 This is more of Inner Team Integration by using Autogen calls multiple Inner Agent and UserProxy is used to ask a question with Human Input.

✅ Created a multi-agent inner team with at least 3 specialized agents
✅  Integrate UserProxyAgent to allow human intervention at critical decision points
✅ Implement human feedback loops where the user can:
	✅ Approve/reject agent recommendations
	✅ Provide additional context or constraints
	✅ Override agent decisions when necessary

****Part B: Outer Team Integration 
🧑‍💻  ****Outer Team Integration.

* 📚 This is more of Outer Team Integration by using Autogen calls multiple Inner Agent and UserProxy is used to ask a question with Human Input.

✅ Design an outer team structure that coordinates multiple inner teams
✅ Position UserProxyAgent strategically to manage inter-team communication
✅ Enable human oversight of:
✅ Team coordination decisions , Resource allocation between teams, Final output validation
