🧠 CrewAI is an open-source Python framework designed to orchestrate autonomous AI agents into collaborative teams, or "crews," to complete complex tasks. It works by assigning specialized roles to different agents, mirroring the structure of a human organization

🧑‍💻 Objective :  

Core Components of CrewAI
Agents: Individual AI units defined by a role, goal, and backstory. They act as specialized team members (e.g., "Senior Researcher" or "Technical Writer").
Tasks: Specific assignments given to agents. They require a clear description and an "expected output" to guide the agent's work.
Crews: The container that brings agents and tasks together. It defines the strategy for how they collaborate and the order in which they work.
Tools: Functions or skills that agents can use to interact with the world, such as searching the internet, reading files, or calling APIs.
Processes: The workflow logic governing execution:
Sequential: Tasks are completed one by one in a specific order.
Hierarchical: A "manager" agent is automatically created (or custom-defined) to delegate tasks and validate results.
