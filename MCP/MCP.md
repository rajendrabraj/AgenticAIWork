##  **📝MCP Server MCP Client and MCP Tools Implementation using n8n 

This is for tools integration with MCOP and n8n and then registering them using Claude and Cursor and executing the worklfow.

Integration between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and n8n turns n8n into a centralized orchestration hub where AI agents can both use n8n workflows as tools and call external MCP-hosted services. 

The integration typically works in two primary directions: 


1. n8n as an MCP Server (Exposing Workflows) 

In this mode, you turn your n8n workflows into "tools" that external AI agents (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) can discover and execute. 
MCP Server Trigger Node: This node acts as the entry point. It generates a unique URL (SSE endpoint) that external clients connect to.
Tool Registration: You connect standard n8n nodes (like Google Calendar, Slack, or HTTP Requests) to the trigger. You must define a JSON schema within the trigger node to tell the AI what parameters (e.g., email_address, message_body) the tool expects


2. n8n as an MCP Client (Consuming External Tools)3. 
In this mode, your n8n AI agents use tools hosted on other MCP servers (e.g., a Brave Search MCP or a GitHub MCP). 
MCP Client Tool Node: You add this node to an n8n AI Agent workflow. It points to an external server's URL.
Capability Expansion: This allows n8n agents to perform tasks for which there isn't a native n8n node yet, simply by connecting to an existing MCP serv
