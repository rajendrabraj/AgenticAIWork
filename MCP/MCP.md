##  **📝MCP Server MCP Client and MCP Tools Implementation using n8n 

This is for tools integration with MCOP and n8n and then registering them using Claude and Cursor and executing the worklfow.

Integration between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and n8n turns n8n into a centralized orchestration hub where AI agents can both use n8n workflows as tools and call external MCP-hosted services. 
The integration typically works in two primary directions: 
1. n8n as an MCP Server (Exposing Workflows) 
In this mode, you turn your n8n workflows into "tools" that external AI agents (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) can discover and execute. 
MCP Server Trigger Node: This node acts as the entry point. It generates a unique URL (SSE endpoint) that external clients connect to.
Tool Registration: You connect standard n8n nodes (like Google Calendar, Slack, or HTTP Requests) to the trigger. You must define a JSON schema within the trigger node to tell the AI what parameters (e.g., email_address, message_body) the tool expects
